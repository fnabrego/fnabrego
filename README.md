<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Franco Nicolas Abrego</h1>
<h2 align="center"> Passionate Full Stack Web Developer dedicated to building robust and scalable solutions. </h2>
<h3 align="left">I'm a full stack developer from Mendoza, Argentina.
  
With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend development, I possess a comprehensive command of key technologies including Javascript, Typescript, Node.js, React, Redux, HTML, and CSS. My experience encompasses creating efficient APIs with Express and NestJS, as well as building modern and dynamic web applications using frameworks like Next.js.

My database management skills cover both relational (SQL, PostgreSQL) and non-relational (NoSQL, MongoDB) systems, allowing me to adapt to the specific needs of each project. In my daily workflow, I utilize tools such as VSCode and am proficient with deployment platforms like Render and cloud services including Cloudinary and Firebase (including authentication with Auth0).

Beyond my technical proficiencies, I deeply value teamwork and effective communication. My participation in an intensive three-week final project, alongside a team of 3 frontend and 4 backend developers, provided invaluable experience in coordinating tasks and managing modifications to achieve defined objectives.

In this project, I actively contributed to the implementation of complex functionalities such as session persistence, JWT login, and third-party authentication, including integration with Google via Firebase. I also participated in the implementation of a payment gateway, the management of various user roles (featuring an administrative dashboard for statistics, order and user management, and shipment tracking), and the automated generation of PDF receipts stored in the Firebase cloud.

Furthermore, we worked with an SQL database (PostgreSQL), utilized Cloudinary for profile picture storage, and employed Nodemailer for automated email notifications (registration, data changes, shipment tracking, etc.). The backend was successfully deployed on Render alongside the PostgreSQL database, while the frontend was deployed on Vercel.

This challenge not only involved the application of my technical knowledge but also the learning and adoption of new tools, as well as effective team coordination to meet the Product Owner's expectations.

I invite you to explore all my repositories on here to learn more about my work style and the projects I have been involved in.

I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to bring my skills and passion for web development to new challenges!
